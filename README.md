# js-component-seed

## Definition

In the following, I will refer js-component-seed as This Project, and project that follows my recommended procedure of building and publishing as Package.

## Purpose

I create this project to demonstrate one way of publishing a testable javascript package that can be shared across our community.

## Why & How

Knowing the fact that nearly every single commercial and open-source software around the world are built upon a vast amount of dependencies, dependency package maintainers are responsible for the compatibility, maintainability, and robustness of their work, which is not an easy one to achieve. This project helps to build compatible, maintainable, and testable packages by imposing the following noticeable methods and third-party dependencies.

- Babel -> Javascript compiler.
- JsDoc -> Code documentation.
- EsLint -> Linting utility.
- Jest -> Test framework.

## Output

This project gives two versions of build outputs. 
- One version produces ES5 syntax with CommonJS module
- While the other provides ECMAScript 2015 syntax with ECMAScript module.
